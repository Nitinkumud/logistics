            Eazeeship offsets greenhouse gas emissions from last-mile deliveries by investing in
            third-party verified carbon-offset projects. In Canada, Eazeeship partners with
            <strong>Carbonzero</strong> for GHG measurement, reduction, and carbon-offsetting solutions.
            Projects include the B.C. Greenhouse Biomass to Energy Project in Abbotsford, British Columbia
            and the Ontario Greenhouse Biomass to Energy Project, in Leamington and Flamborough, Ontario.

            Eazeeship partners with <strong>veritree</strong> to enhance its sustainability initiatives through
            verified reforestation, planting a verified tree for every 200 mid-mile kilometres driven. This
            collaboration supports the restoration of the Cariboo Region in British Columbia, which has been
            significantly impacted by wildfires.
